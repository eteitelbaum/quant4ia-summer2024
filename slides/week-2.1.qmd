## Where Does Data Come From?

<br>

Thoughts? :sunglasses: :thought_balloon:

. . .

:::{.incremental}
- Your boss or a client sends you a file
- Survey data collected by you or someone else 
- You can download it from a website 
- You can scrape it from a website
- A curated collection (e.g. `unvotes`)
- You can access it through an API
:::

## The Concept of "Tidy Data"

<br>

- Each column represents a single variable
- Each row represents a single observation
- Each cell represents a single value

## Tidy Data Example

![](images/tidy_data.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## The Concept of "Clean Data"

<br>

- Column names are easy to work with and are not duplicated
- Missing values have been dealt with
- There are no repeated observations or columns
- There are no blank observations or columns
- The data are in the proper format
  - For example dates should be formatted as dates

## Messy Data Example

![](images/messy_wb_data.jpg){fig-align="center" width=70%}

## Which of These is Likely Tidy/Clean?

<br>

- Your boss or a client sends you a file
- Survey data collected by you or someone else 
- You can download it from a website 
- You can scrape it from a website
- A curated collection (e.g. `unvotes`)
- You can access it through an API

## How Do We Get Tidy/Clean Data? 

<br>

- Wrangle it ourselves
- Use a package where it has been wrangled for us
- Download via an API 

## APIs

<br>

- API stands for "Application Programming Interface"
- Way for two computers to talk to each other

- For IA, we coulduse APIs to download social science data

## APIs for IA

::: {.incremental}
- APIs are accessed through packages in R
- Much easier than reading in data from messy flat file!
- Here are a few examples:
  - World Bank data through `wbstats` or `WDI`
  - `countrycode` for country codes
  - `eurostat` for data on Europe
- But there are many APIs out there (please explore!)
:::

## This Lesson

<br>

::: {.incremental}
- Access V-Dem data with `vdemdata` Package
- This is the only package for V-Dem
- Just imports all the data
- So we have to use `dplyr` functions like `filter()` and `select()`
:::

## 

<br>

- Run this code and see what happens. 
- What is `vdem` and what does it do? 

```{r}
#| label: vdemdata1
#| echo: true

# Load packages
library(vdemdata) # to download V-Dem data
library(dplyr)

# Download the data
democracy <- vdem 

# View the data
glimpse(democracy)
```

## `filter()`, `select()`, `mutate()`

<br>

- `filter()` is used to select observations based on their values
- `select()` is used to select variables
- `mutate()` is used to create new variables or modifying existing ones

## `filter()`

- Run this code. What do you see?
- Try changing the year 
- For one year, use `==` instead of `>=`
- Or try `<=` and see what happens 

```{r}
#| label: vdemdata2
#| echo: true

democracy <- vdem |> # download the V-Dem dataset
  filter(year >= 1990) # filter out years less than 1990
  
glimpse(democracy)  
```

```{r}
#| label: timer1
library(countdown)
countdown(minutes = 5, 
          id = "timer1", 
          top = "10%", 
          right = "10%",
          color_border = "#fff",
          color_text = "#fff",
          color_running_background = "#42affa",
          color_running_text = "black",
          color_finished_background = "#E5D19D",
          color_finished_text = "#00264A")
```

## `=` versus `==`

<br>

- `=` is used to assign values to variables, just like `<-`
- `==` is used to test if two values are equal to each other
- So `filter(year == 1990)` will give you just the observations for 1990

## `>=` and `<=`

- `>=` is used to test if a value is greater than or equal to another value
- `<=` is used to test if a value is less than or equal to another value
- So `filter(year >= 1990)` will give you the observations for 1990 and later
- And `filter(year <= 1990)` will give you the observations for 1990 and earlier

## `select()`

- Run this code. What do you see?
- Now try `v2x_libdem` instead of `v2x_polyarchy`
- Choose more from the [codebook](https://v-dem.net/documents/24/codebook_v13.pdf) 

```{r}
#| label: vdemdata3
#| echo: true

democracy <- vdem |> # download the V-Dem dataset
  select(                  # select (and rename) these variables
    country = country_name,     # before the = sign is new name  
    vdem_ctry_id = country_id,  # after the = sign is the old name
    year, 
    polyarchy = v2x_polyarchy
  )
  
glimpse(democracy)  
```

```{r}
#| label: timer2
countdown(minutes = 5, 
          id = "timer2",
          top = "0%",
          right = "5%")
```

## `mutate()`

- Modify the code to create new variable that is three times the value of `polyarchy` 
- How about `polyarchy` squared? 

```{r}
#| label: vdemdata4
#| echo: true

democracy <- vdem |> # download the V-Dem dataset
  filter(year == 2015) |> # keep only observations from 2015
  select(                  # select (and rename) these variables
    country = country_name,     # name before the = sign is new name  
    vdem_ctry_id = country_id,  # name after the = sign is old name
    year, 
    polyarchy = v2x_polyarchy 
    ) |>
  mutate(
    polyarchy_dbl = polyarchy * 2 # create variable 2X polyarchy
  )
  
glimpse(democracy)  
```

```{r}
#| label: timer3
countdown(minutes = 5, 
          id = "timer2",
          top = "0%",
          right = "5%")
```

## Some Common Arithmetic Operators

<br>

- `+` addition
- `-` subtraction
- `*` multiplication
- `/` division
- `^` exponentiation (also `**`)

## `vdemdata` Example {.smaller}

```{r}
#| label: vdemdata5
#| output: false
#| echo: true

# Load packages
library(vdemdata) # to download V-Dem data
library(dplyr)

# Download the data
democracy <- vdem |> # download the V-Dem dataset
  filter(year == 2015)  |> # filter year, keep 2015
  select(                  # select (and rename) these variables
    country = country_name,     # the name before the = sign is the new name  
    vdem_ctry_id = country_id,  # the name after the = sign is the old name
    year, 
    polyarchy = v2x_polyarchy, 
    gdp_pc = e_gdppc, 
    region = e_regionpol_6C
    ) |>
  mutate(
    region = case_match(region, # replace the values in region with country names
                     1 ~ "Eastern Europe", 
                     2 ~ "Latin America",  
                     3 ~ "Middle East",   
                     4 ~ "Africa", 
                     5 ~ "The West", 
                     6 ~ "Asia")
  )

# View the data
glimpse(democracy)
```

## 

Use `filter()` to select years...

```{r}
#| label: vdemdata6
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "2-3"

# Download the data
democracy <- vdem |> 
  filter(year == 2015)  |> # keep 2015
  select(                 
    country = country_name,       
    vdem_ctry_id = country_id,  
    year, 
    polyarchy = v2x_polyarchy, 
    gdp_pc = e_gdppc, 
    region = e_regionpol_6C
    ) |>
  mutate(
    region = case_match(region,
                     1 ~ "Eastern Europe", 
                     2 ~ "Latin America",  
                     3 ~ "Middle East",   
                     4 ~ "Africa", 
                     5 ~ "The West", 
                     6 ~ "Asia")
  )
```

## 

Use `select()` to choose variables...

```{r}
#| label: vdemdata7
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "4-11"

# Download the data
democracy <- vdem |> 
  filter(year == 2015)  |> 
  select(                  # select (and rename) these variables
    country = country_name,     # the name before the = sign is the new name  
    vdem_ctry_id = country_id,  # the name after the = sign is the old name
    year, 
    polyarchy = v2x_polyarchy, 
    gdp_pc = e_gdppc, 
    region = e_regionpol_6C
    ) |>
  mutate(
    region = case_match(region, 
                     1 ~ "Eastern Europe", 
                     2 ~ "Latin America",  
                     3 ~ "Middle East",   
                     4 ~ "Africa", 
                     5 ~ "The West", 
                     6 ~ "Asia")
  )
```

## 

Use `mutate` with `case_match()` to Recode Region....

```{r}
#| label: vdemdata8
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "12-23"

# Download the data
democracy <- vdem |>
  filter(year == 2015)  |> 
  select(                  
    country = country_name,     
    vdem_ctry_id = country_id,  
    year, 
    polyarchy = v2x_polyarchy, 
    gdp_pc = e_gdppc, 
    region = e_regionpol_6C
    ) |>
  mutate(
    region = case_match(region, # replace the values in region with country names
                     1 ~ "Eastern Europe", 
                     2 ~ "Latin America",  
                     3 ~ "Middle East",   
                     4 ~ "Africa", 
                     5 ~ "The West", 
                     6 ~ "Asia")
                    # number on the left of the ~ is the V-Dem region code
                    # we are changing the number to the country name on the right
                    # of the equals sign
  )
```

## Visualize It! 

```{r}
#| label: scatterplot1
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(democracy, aes(x = gdp_pc, y = polyarchy)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = region)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", linewidth = 1) + 
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number(prefix = "$", suffix = "k")) +
  labs(
    x= "GDP per Capita", 
    y = "Polyarchy Score",
    title = "Wealth and democracy in 2015", 
    caption = "Source: V-Dem Institute", 
    color = "Region"
    ) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = "inferno", end = .8)
```

## Visualize It! 

```{r}
#| label: scatterplot2

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(democracy, aes(x = gdp_pc, y = polyarchy)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = region)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", linewidth = 1) + 
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number(prefix = "$", suffix = "k")) +
  labs(
    x= "GDP per Capita", 
    y = "Polyarchy Score",
    title = "Wealth and democracy in 2020", 
    caption = "Source: V-Dem Institute", 
    color = "Region"
    ) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = "inferno", end = .8) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Try it Yourself

- Go to the V-Dem [Codebook](https://www.v-dem.net/documents/24/codebook_v13.pdf) 
- Select a democracy indicator from Part 2.1 (high level indicators) to visualize
- Note the indicator code (e.g. "v2x_polyarchy" for the polyarchy score)
- Change the code and download the data so you can visualize it
- Now make a scatter plot of your indicator versus GDP
- Bonus: How would you make a line chart?

```{r}
#| label: timer4

countdown(minutes = 10, 
          id = "timer4", 
          top = "5%", 
          right = "10%")
```
