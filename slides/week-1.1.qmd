## Why Take this Course?

<br>

-   International Affairs is changing!
-   Data is everywhere and it is changing the way government works
-   You will be a better consumer of data and research
-   You can be a "bridge builder" between traditional analysts and data scientists on your team

## Data Informed Dipomacy

<br>

> Data is a critical instrument of diplomacy. When our workforce has data at their fingertips they are better prepared to engage diplomatically, manage effectively, and lead globally.

| Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, 2022[^1]

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Cultivate a Data Culture
- Accelerate Decisions through Analytics
- Establish Mission-Driven Data Management
- Enhance Enterprise Data Governance
:::
:::

## Open Goverment Data Act (2018)

- Requires government data assets to be published as machine-readable data in open formats 
- Requires Chief Data Officers (CDOs) to be appointed at federal agencies
- Requires CDOs to develop and maintain comprehensive data inventories
- Has led to a proliferation of data science roles in the federal government

:::

## Open Source Intelligence 

<br>

- More than 90% of the analysis in the intelligence community is based on open source information
- Government agencies use a lot of the same datasets that we will be using in this class
- Yet the OSINT community has only begun to scratch the surface of what is possible with data science

## 

<br>

::: notes
MLP's digital tools provide fine-grained data tracking and forecasting major political events across nearly 60 countries by continuously scraping and process tens of millions of articles published by more than 300 local, regional, and international news sources in more than 30 languages. This infrastructure provides up-to-date data on recent and historical trends in civic space and foreign influence and builds forecasting models that learn from historical patterns to predict how conditions are likely to change in the near future.

## Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning

::: {.incremental}
- Another important use of data in international affairs is monitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL)
- MEL is a process that helps organizations track and assess the performance of their programs
- MEL is a key component of [USAID](https://www.usaid.gov/activity-monitoring-evaluation-and-learning-mel-plan), the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime/research) and other agencies 
- A major component of MEL is the use of randomized control trials (RCTs) and other designs, which you will learn about in this class
:::

library(countdown)
countdown(minutes = 3, 
          id = "timer1", 
          top = "0%",
          right = "5%",
          color_border = "#fff",
          color_text = "#fff",
          color_running_background = "#42affa",
          color_running_text = "black",

![](images/install-packages.gif){fig-align="center"}

```{r}
#| label: timer2

countdown(minutes = 3, 
          id = "timer2",
          top = "0%",
          right = "5%")
```

## Let's get going . . .

<br>

Your first data visualizations...

(and making sure we have R and RStudio installed and ready to roll)

## Example: Make a map!

```{r}
#| label: leaflet_map

library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>%   # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lat = 38.90243843683386, lng =  -77.0443814477152, 
             label = "Elliott School of International Affairs")
```

## Example: Plotting Democracy Over Time

```{r}
#| label: plot_democracy

# For nice colors that work for color blind
cbPalette <- c("#999999", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7")

library(vdemdata)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
# We will use the data called vdem
vdem %>%
  # and then we are going to filter out and only use France and India
  filter(country_name == "France" | country_name == "India") %>%
  # and then we are going to only use years since 1850
  filter(year > 1849) %>% 
    # and then we are going to use this filtered data to make a plot
    #with democracy on the y axis and year on the x
    # we want this plot to use different colors for each country
    ggplot(., aes(y = v2x_polyarchy, x = year, color=country_name)) +
      geom_line() +
      theme_minimal() +
      xlab("Year") +
      ylab("Electoral Democracy Index") +
      ggtitle("Electoral Democracy, 1850-2022") +
      geom_hline(yintercept = .5, linetype = "dashed", color = "grey") +
       scale_color_manual(name="Country", values=c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9")) +
      ylim(0, 1)
```

## Example: UN Voting Trends

```{r}
#| label: un_voting

library(tidyverse)
library(unvotes)
library(lubridate)
library(scales)
library(pacman)

unvotes <- un_votes %>%
  inner_join(un_roll_calls, by = "rcid") %>%
  inner_join(un_roll_call_issues, by = "rcid")

unvotes %>%
  # then filter out to only include the countries we want
  filter(country %in% c("South Africa", "United States", "France")) %>%
  # then make sure R understands the the year variable is a data
  mutate(year = year(date)) %>%
  # Then group the data by country and year
  group_by(country, year, issue) %>%
  # then take the average Yes votes for each country_year
  summarize(percent_yes = mean(vote == "yes")) %>%
  # then make a nice plot
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = percent_yes, color = country)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~issue) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +
  scale_color_manual( values=c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73")) +
  labs(
    title = "Percentage of 'Yes' votes in the UN General Assembly",
    subtitle = "1946 to 2019",
    y = "% Yes",
    x = "Year",
    color = "Country"
  )
```

countdown(minutes = 2, 
          id = "timer3", 
          bottom = "0%",
          right = "5%")
```

## Markdown

<br>

::: {.incremental}
-   Markdown is a simple markup language
-   You can use it to format text
-   You can also use it to embed images, tables, etc.
-   And to embed code chunks...
:::

## Markdown Syntax - Basic Authoring

::: {.incremental}
-   For basic text you can just start typing
-   For line breaks use two spaces and return (enter)
-   Headings (use `#`, `##`, `###`, etc.)
    -   `#` is the largest heading (level 1)
    -   `##` is the next largest (level 2)
    -   `###` is the next largest (level 3)
    -   Etc.
:::

## Markdown Syntax - Styling

::: {.incremental}
-   Emphasis = Italics (use `*`)
    -   Bold (use `**`)
-   Lists
    -   Bullet points (use `-`)
    -   Numbered lists (use `1.`)
:::

## Markdown Syntax - Content

::: {.incremental}
-   Links (use `[text](url)`)
-   Images (use `![](file path or url)`)
-   Code chunks
    -   R code chunks (\`\`\`{r}...\`\`\`)
    -   Python code chunks (\`\`\`{python}...\`\`\`)
    -   Etc. 
:::

## Try Some Markdown

<br>

-   Check out the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
-   Try editing the markdown in your document
-   Try some of the other things you find in the guide
-   Then render it again

```{r}
#| label: timer4

countdown(minutes = 10, 
          id = "timer4", 
          bottom = "10%",
          right = "10%")
```

## Code Chunks

::: {.incremental}
-   Incorporate R code (could also be Python, Julia, etc.)
-   Add a code chunk with the '+' button
-   Run the code chunk by clicking the play button
    -   Or use keyboard shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Enter)
-   Run all chunks up that point by clicking the down arrow
    -   Or use keyboard shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + K)
-  Run a single line with shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl + Enter) 
:::

## Code Chunk Options

::: {.incremental}
-   Use `#|` (hash-pipe) to add options 
-   `label` is a unique identifier for the chunk
-   Options to control what happens when you render
    -   `echo` controls whether the code is shown
    -   `eval` controls whether the code is run
    -   `message` controls whether messages are shown
    -   `warning` controls whether warnings are shown
:::

## Code Chunk Options

<br>

-   Code-chunk options override global options set in YAML header
-   See [documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-knitr.html) for more options
-   You can also use write chunk options inline with chunk name,
    -   e.g., `{r, echo = FALSE} ...`
    
## Illustration

![](images/code-chunks.gif){fig-align="center"}

## Try it Yourself! 

-  Create a code chunk
-  Copy this code chunk into your document

```{r}
#| label: chunk1
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| 
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) + 
  geom_point()
```

-  Try adding some chunk options in your document
-  Then render it again

```{r}
#| label: timer5

countdown(minutes = 2, 
          id = "timer5", 
          bottom = "10%",
          right = "10%")
```

# A Bit About R

## R Packages and Functions {.smaller}

<br>

::: {.incremental}
-   A *function* is a set of instructions
    -   `read_csv()` is a function
    -   `ggplot()` is a function
-   A *package* is a collection of functions
    -   `readr` is a package that contains the `read_csv()` function
    -   `ggplot2` is a package that contains the `ggplot()` function
-   Use `install.packages()` to install packages
-   Use `library()` to load packages
-   You can install packages from CRAN
:::

## The Tidyverse {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
-   The Tidyverse is a collection of data science packages
-   It is also considered a dialect of R
-   In this class, we will be using many Tidyverse packages
    -   `ggplot2` for data visualization
    -   `readr` for reading data
    -   `dplyr` for data manipulation
    -   `tidyr` for data tidying
    -   Etc.
-   At first we will load the packages independently, e.g. `library(ggplot2)`
-   Later we will load them all at once with `library(tidyverse)`
