Is this a successful program?\n\n## Today's Code\n\n<https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/g4tdpdwcij78nyydvr4bp/h?rlkey=hctskhle6222csnwre5ir9gz3&dl=0>\n\n## \n\n<br>\n\nNow let's create some data to match our hypothetical example.\n\n<br>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\njobs_program <- tibble(\n  outcome = c(rep(\"unemployed\", 15), rep(\"employed\", 45))\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## \n\n<br>\n\nUse the base R `head()` function to see the first five rows.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(jobs_program)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 1\n  outcome   \n  <chr>     \n1 unemployed\n2 unemployed\n3 unemployed\n4 unemployed\n5 unemployed\n6 unemployed\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## \n\n<br>\n\nUse the `tail()` function to see the last five rows.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntail(jobs_program)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 1\n  outcome \n  <chr>   \n1 employed\n2 employed\n3 employed\n4 employed\n5 employed\n6 employed\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## \n\n<br>\n\nNow let's visualize it with a bar chart.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](week-4.1_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Question\n\n<br>\n\nIs it possible to assess this hypothetical organization's claim using the data and information presented thus far?\n\n>\"Our jobs program is a success because only 15 of the 60 people that we trained did not have a job. Thus our 25% unemployment rate beats the country's unemployment rate of 30%.\"\n\n## Correlation vs. causation\n\n<br>\n\n-   No.\n- We need to know more about how people were selected for the program in order to assess causality (e.g., were they randomly assigned?)\n-   But, we can still ask whether the unemployment rate of $\\hat{p}$ = 0.25 could be due to chance.\n\n## Hypothesis Testing Intuition {.smaller}\n\n<br>\n\n- We are going to assume \"nothing is going on\"\n    - In this case, the jobs program had no impact\n\n. . .\n\n- We are going to figure out what the distribution of outcomes we we might observe could be if nothing is going on\n    - In this case: if we take a sample of 60 from a population where the parameter is 0.3\n\n. . .\n\n- We will assess how likely we would be to observe our data if nothing is going on\n    - If very unlikely, we conclude that something is probably going on\n\n## Stating our Hypotheses\n\n<br>\n\n**Null hypothesis ($H_0$):** \"There is nothing going on.\"\n\n> Unemployment rate among those in the jobs program is no different than the country average of 30%.\n\n. . .\n\n**Alternative hypothesis ($H_A$):** \"There is something going on.\"\n\n> Unemployment rate is **lower** than the country average of 30%.\n\n\n## Hypothesis Test\n\n<br>\n\n::: incremental\n- **Hypothesis test:** If the null hypothesis were true, is the data we have in our sample likely to have been generated by chance (due to random variability)?\n- If yes, we do NOT reject the null hypothesis\n- If not very likely, we reject the null hypothesis \n:::\n\n## Hypothesis Testing Framework \n\n::: incremental\n-   Start with null hypothesis, $H_0$, represents the status quo\n-   Set an alternative hypothesis, $H_A$, that represents the research question, i.e. what we're testing for\n-   Conduct a hypothesis test under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true \n    -   if the test results suggest that the data do not provide convincing evidence for the alternative hypothesis, stick with the null hypothesis\n    -   if they do, then reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative\n:::\n\n## p-values and Critical Values\n\n<br>\n\n::: incremental\n- A **p-value** is the probability of observed or more extreme outcome given that the null hypothesis is true\n- A critical value ($\\alpha$) is the threshold at which we will reject the null hypothesis\n- If the p-value is less than $\\alpha$, we reject the null hypothesis\n- A standard threshold for $\\alpha$ is 0.05\n:::\n\n## The Null Distribution\n\n<br>\n\n-   Since $H_0: p = 0.30$, we need to simulate a null distribution where the probability of success (unemployment) for each trial (person in program) is 0.30\n\n. . .\n\n-   We want to know how likely we would be to get an unemployment rate of 0.25 in our sample of 60, *if the true unemployment rate were 0.30*\n\n\n## What do we expect?\n\n<br>\n\n::: incremental\n- So the first step is to simulate our null distribution\n- And the question is, when sampling from the null distribution, what is the expected proportion of unemployed?\n- We set up our simulator to select samples of 60 individuals with a 30% chance of being unemployed\n- We then calculate the proportion of unemployed in each sample\n:::\n\n## Simulation #1\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nsim1\n  employed unemployed \n        42         18 \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.3\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](week-4.1_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Simulation #2\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nsim2\n  employed unemployed \n        41         19 \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.3166667\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](week-4.1_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Simulation #3\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nsim3\n  employed unemployed \n        38         22 \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.3666667\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](week-4.1_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## We need to do this many times...\n\n## `tidymodels`\n\n<br>\n\nWe can use the `tidymodels` package to help with this process...\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#load tidymodels\nlibrary(tidymodels)\n\n# simulate the distribution\nnull_dist <- jobs_program |>\n  specify(response = outcome, success = \"unemployed\") |>\n  hypothesize(null = \"point\", p = c(\"unemployed\" = 0.30, \"employed\" = 0.70)) |>\n  generate(reps = 2000, type = \"draw\") |> \n  calculate(stat = \"prop\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## What is being stored in *null_dist*?\n\n<br>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nResponse: outcome (factor)\nNull Hypothesis: point\n# A tibble: 2,000 × 2\n   replicate  stat\n       <dbl> <dbl>\n 1         1 0.367\n 2         2 0.2  \n 3         3 0.283\n 4         4 0.2  \n 5         5 0.4  \n 6         6 0.317\n 7         7 0.3  \n 8         8 0.333\n 9         9 0.283\n10        10 0.25 \n# ℹ 1,990 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## The null distribution\n\n<br>\n\nWhere should this distribution be centered?
