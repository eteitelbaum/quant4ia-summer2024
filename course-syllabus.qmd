## Aiming For Success

I care about your learning and also about this subject matter, and I am here to help you have a meaningful learning experience. I expect you to take ownership of your learning: you can get more out of the course by thoughtfully participating in discussions, actively taking notes on readings and lectures, and giving your best effort overall. I will hold you to the highest standards for academic honesty and integrity in your work. I will also encourage you to collaborate and learn from your peers through thoughtful and respectful discussion. I must highlight that communication is vital, so I hope you feel comfortable reaching out to me if you are struggling or have concerns or need [accommodations beyond accessibility](#_heading=h.41mghml). We can determine strategies to set you up for success. Finally, I look forward to collaborating with you in this course to create a meaningful experience for everyone.

# Policy on AI Tools

**Overview:**

The use of ChatGPT can be a valuable tool for students in this course, but it is important to use it ethically and appropriately. By following the guidelines and expectations outlined in this syllabus policy, students can maximize the benefits of using ChatGPT while also demonstrating their own critical thinking, research, and programming skills.

As part of this course, students will have the option to use ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI, to assist in the writing of their R scripts for specific course assignments. ChatGPT can provide students with a starting point for their code but often the code is incomplete or error-prone. It is important to recognize that ChatGPT is a tool and not a substitute for critical thinking, research, or programming skills. Therefore, this syllabus policy outlines the guidelines and expectations for using ChatGPT in this course.

**Guidelines:**

Use ChatGPT ethically and honestly. Do not use ChatGPT to plagiarize or take credit for work that is not your own. Any use of ChatGPT must be properly cited and referenced in accordance with the university's code of academic integrity.

Recognize the limitations of ChatGPT. ChatGPT is a machine learning model and may not always provide the most accurate or relevant information. Therefore, it is important to critically evaluate the information and verify it with other sources.

Use ChatGPT appropriately. ChatGPT should only be used to assist in writing boilerplate syntax for this course. It's a starting point. It should not be used to attempt to complete other assignments or assessments in this course or in other courses.

If you think you might miss an assignment deadline, it is your responsibility to contact me via email. We know life happens sometimes and will be as accommodating as possible, but it **is important that you communicate with us in advance.** If we do not hear from you, we will deduct 2.5 percentage points from your grade for every 24 hours the assignment is late.

## Incomplete Grades

Incomplete grades may be given to graduate students only if for reasons beyond the student's control (such as medical or family emergency) they are unable to complete the final work of the course. Faculty should not assign an Incomplete grade if not asked by the student.

For further information, please consult with your advisor.

## Course Communication

Communication in our course is essential; clearing up questions earlier than later is a good practice, so please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

We will communicate to you primarily through [GW's Blackboard System](https://blackboard.gwu.edu). Announcements and emails sent through Blackboard automatically go to your GW email address (i.e., userid\@gwu.edu). Please check your GW email account on a daily basis or forward your GW email to another address that you check daily.

I will respond to emails/discussion posts within 48 hours (i.e., "24 hours on weekdays and on the next business day over weekends and holidays.") I will provide feedback on assignments/exams within 3 days (i.e., "five days on weekdays and on the next business day over weekends and holidays.")

You can post general course-related questions to our Discord server. Please post your question here first rather than emailing me directly if your question regards the course material. However, if you have a question that is more personal in nature (i.e., grades), please email me directly to set up an appointment.

## Netiquette

Behind every name there is a person.

To ensure safe and meaningful learning experiences for everyone, we all agree to:

-   Remain professional, respectful, and courteous at all times on all platforms.
-   Keep in mind this is a college class. Something that would be inappropriate in an in-person classroom is also inappropriate in an online classroom.
-   When upset, we'll wait a day or two prior to posting. Messages posted or emailed in anger are often regretted later.
-   Ask one another for clarification if we find a communication offensive or difficult to understand.
-   Avoid sweeping generalizations. Back up our stated opinions with facts and reliable sources.
-   Understand that we may disagree and that exposure to other people's opinions is part of the learning experience.
-   Just as we would like our privacy respected, we will respect the privacy of other course participants and what they share.

I (the instructor) reserve the right to delete any post or communication in our course that is deemed inappropriate without prior notification to the student. This includes anything containing language that is offensive, rude, profane, racist, or hateful. Items that are seriously off-topic or serve no purpose other than to vent frustration will also be removed.

Using outside communication apps

I am aware that you and your peers might communicate using tools outside of GW's Blackboard, my course website, our course Discord channel, or email systems. Rules of netiquette and appropriate communication extend to these tools as well as to Blackboard. If you see any tool being used inappropriately (i.e., any communication containing language that is offensive, rude, profane, racist, or hateful; uses that promote cheating of any kind), contact me as soon as possible to speak privately about it.

## Accessibility and Accommodations

### GW's Disability Support Services

If you are a student with a disability, or think you may have a disability, you can let me know, and/or you can talk to [GW's Office of Disability Support Services (DSS)](https://disabilitysupport.gwu.edu/). DSS works with both students with disabilities and instructors to identify reasonable accommodations. Contact the DSS office at (202) 994-8250, by email on dss\@gwu.edu, or in-person in Rome Hall Suite 102 to establish eligibility and to coordinate reasonable accommodations. If you have already been approved for accommodations, please send me your accommodation letter and meet with me so we can develop an implementation plan together.

How are course technology tools accessible to everyone? To find out, access **Technology Support Technology Tools Policies** in the Blackboard course menu.

### Accommodations Beyond Disability

Everyone has different needs for learning. If you don't have a documented disability but feel that you would benefit from learning support for other reasons, please don't hesitate to talk to me. If you have substantial non-academic obligations or other concerns (e.g., [food insecurity](https://studentlife.gwu.edu/store), work, childcare, athletic commitments, language barriers, financial issues, technology access, commuting, etc.) that make learning difficult, please contact me. I'll keep this information confidential, and together, we can brainstorm ways to meet your needs.

### Other Needs

Any student who has difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or who lacks a safe and stable place to live, and believes this may affect their performance in the course, is urged to contact [GW's Office of Student Financial Assistance](https://financialaid.gwu.edu/emergency-funding) for support. Furthermore, please notify me if you are comfortable doing so. Some other resources to support you are found under the course menu item **Student Resources** and include support for academic achievement and personal well-being. *(Adapted from Goldrick-Rab, 2017)*

## Counseling and Psychological Services

GW's Health Center offers [counseling and psychological services](http://counselingcenter.gwu.edu) to GW students. ***Please note that staff is licensed to offer short term therapy to students in Washington, DC, Maryland, and Virginia. If you are living outside these regions, the office may be able to refer you elsewhere.*** Assistance and referrals 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and can be reached on (202) 994-5300.

The Center provides assistance and referral to address students' personal, social, career, and study skills problems. Services for students include: crisis and emergency mental health consultations, confidential assessment, counseling services (individual and small group), and referrals.

[Virtual Workshops](https://healthcenter.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs1216/f/image/Virtual%20Workshop%20Flyer.pdf) are open to any student regardless of geographic location. These can be exceptionally valuable and help you build essential skills and cope with common ongoing mental health concerns. Please contact the [GW Health Center](https://healthcenter.gwu.edu) on (202) 994-5300 for more information.

## Religious Observances

As members of the GW community, you have the right to observe religious holidays. University policy requires that students notify their instructors during the first week of the semester if they plan to be absent from class on days of religious observance. For further details, please consult [the university policy on religious holiday observance](http://registrar.gwu.edu/university-policies#holidays).

## Emergency Preparedness and Response Procedures

The University has asked all faculty to inform students of these procedures, prepared by the GW Office of Public Safety and Emergency Management in collaboration with the Office of the Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs.

### To Report an Emergency or Suspicious Activity

Call the University Police Department at 202-994-6111 (Foggy Bottom) or 202-242-6111 (Mount Vernon).

### Shelter in Place – General Guidance

Although it is unlikely that we will ever need to shelter in place, it is helpful to know what to do just in case. No matter where you are, the basic steps of shelter in place will generally remain the same.

- If you are inside, stay where you are unless the building you are in is affected. If it is affected, you should evacuate. If you are outdoors, proceed into the closest building or follow instructions from emergency personnel on the scene.
- Locate an interior room to shelter inside. If possible, it should be above ground level and have the fewest number of windows. If sheltering in a room with windows, move away from the windows. If there is a large group of people inside a particular building, several rooms may be necessary.
- Shut and lock all windows (for a tighter seal) and close exterior doors.
- Turn off air conditioners, heaters, and fans. Close vents to ventilation systems as you are able. (University staff will turn off ventilation systems as quickly as possible).
- Make a list of the people with you and ask someone to call the list in to UPD so they know where you are sheltering and who is with you. If only students are present, one of the students should call in the list.
- Await further instructions. If possible, visit [GW Campus Advisories](https://campusadvisories.gwu.edu/) for incident updates or call the GW Information Line 202-994-5050.
- Make yourself comfortable and look after one other. You will get word as soon as it is safe to come out.

### Evacuation

An evacuation will be considered if the building we are in is affected or we must move to a location of greater safety. We will always evacuate if the fire alarm sounds. In the event of an evacuation, please gather your personal belongings quickly (purse, keys, GWorld card, etc.) and proceed to the nearest exit. Every classroom has a map at the door designating both the shortest egress and an alternate egress. Anyone who is physically unable to walk down the stairs should wait in the stairwell, behind the closed doors. Firemen will check the stairwells upon entering the building. Once you have evacuated the building, proceed to our primary rendezvous location: the court yard area between the GW Hospital and Ross Hall. In the event that this location is unavailable, we will meet on the ground level of the Visitors Parking Garage (I Street entrance, at 22nd Street). From our rendezvous location, we will await instructions to re-enter the School.

### Alert DC

Alert DC provides free notification by e-mail or text message during an emergency. Visit [GW Campus Advisories](https://campusadvisories.gwu.edu/) for a link and instructions on how to sign up for alerts pertaining to GW. If you receive an
Alert DC notification during class, you are encouraged to share the information immediately.

### GW Alert

GW Alert provides popup notification to desktop and laptop computers during an emergency. In the event that we receive an alert to the computer in our classroom, we will follow the instructions given. You are also encouraged to download this application to your personal computer. Visit [GW Campus Advisories](https://campusadvisories.gwu.edu/) to learn how.

### Additional Information

Additional information about emergency preparedness and response at GW or the University’s operating status can be found on GW Campus Advisories or by calling the GW Information Line at 202-994-5050.

## Key Dates

Please defer to the due dates listed on the course website. You can also view due dates in the gradebook and under each individual course assignment item in Blackboard Ultra.
